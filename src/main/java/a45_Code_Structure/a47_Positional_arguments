   #  Positional arguments
      +  Are the arguments that are passed based on their position in the function definition
         (This is the normal way we pass arguments in many languages)      

   #  '*'
      +  Can be used to gather Positional arguments as Tuple
      

   #  Example
      >>> def print_more(required1, required2, *args):
      ...   print('Need this one:', required1)
      ...   print('Need this one too:', required2)
      ...   print('All the rest:', args)      
            
      >>> print_more('cap', 'gloves', 'scarf', 'monocle', 'mustache wax')
      Need this one: cap
      Need this one too: gloves
      All the rest: ('scarf', 'monocle', 'mustache wax')
